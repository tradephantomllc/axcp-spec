### NEXCP Convergence

AXCP is evolving in parallel with the NEXCP (Next-generation Exchange Context Protocol) initiative. Starting at **v0.5** we plan a gradual convergence path so that agents implementing AXCP will be wire-compatible with the emerging NEXCP standard.

### Open Governance Working Group

From **v0.4** onward, the project will form an **Open Governance Working Group (WG)** composed of maintainers and early adopters. The WG will steer protocol evolution, approve breaking-change proposals and maintain the public specification.
