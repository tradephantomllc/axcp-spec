# AXCP Public Roadmap

> This roadmap outlines the major milestones planned for the AXCP specification and reference implementations. Dates are best-effort estimates and may shift based on community feedback.

| Milestone | Key features | ETA |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| **v0.4**  | Capability discovery API, signed bundle exchange | 2025-09 |
| **v0.5**  | Adaptive encryption, remote OTEL streaming       | 2025-12 |
| **v1.0**  | LTS, HIPAA/GDPR compliance, spec freeze          | 2026-03 |

AXCP will **converge on NEXCP** over the next few cycles, aligning message formats and transport negotiation so that agents can inter-operate seamlessly across both ecosystems. All breaking changes introduced on this path will follow semantic-versioning pre-release rules.

An **Open Governance Working Group (WG)** will be formed after v0.4 to steer the future of the spec. The WG will be open to vendors, researchers, and individual contributors, ensuring decisions are transparent and consensus-driven.
