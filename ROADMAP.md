# AXCP Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the AXCP (Adaptive eXchange Context Protocol) project.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Key Features | ETA |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| **v0.4**  | Capability discovery API, signed bundle exchange | 2025-09 |
| **v0.5**  | Adaptive encryption, remote OTEL streaming       | 2025-12 |
| **v1.0**  | LTS, HIPAA/GDPR compliance, spec freeze          | 2026-03 |

## NEXCP Convergence

AXCP will converge on NEXCP as the protocol continues to mature. This convergence represents a natural evolution of the protocol architecture, ensuring broader compatibility and enhanced capabilities.

The Open Governance Working Group will oversee this transition, ensuring that the convergence process maintains the core principles of AXCP while enabling interoperability with the broader NEXCP ecosystem.

## Current Status

- **v0.3.x**: Foundation protocols, basic telemetry, CI/CD pipeline
- **Active Development**: Multi-language SDK support, performance optimization
- **Community**: Growing contributor base, documentation improvements
