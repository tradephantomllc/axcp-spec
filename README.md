# axcp-spec
AXCP â€“ Adaptive eXchange Context Protocol. An open specification for ultra-efficient, privacy-preserving AI agent orchestration.
It improves on existing agent communication protocols (like MCP, A2A, and ACP) by integrating:

- QUIC + Protobuf transport for high-performance, low-latency communication  
- Delta-synced context cache to reduce token overhead  
- DIDComm v2 for decentralized capability negotiation and secure identity  
- SGX enclaves and differential privacy for confidential and auditable execution  
- Smart routing between cloud and edge nodes
